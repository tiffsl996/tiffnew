    "## Full Stack and Deployment Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This blog describes a project that will be developed on localhost and then deployed to a publicly available web server. Here are some key elements that need solutions and consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JavaScript Fetch, URI**: The project must manage the switch between development and deployment URI access for frontend requests. This is achieved by including the `assets/js/config.js` file in the `teacher_portfolio` project. This file should be referenced whenever a URL endpoint fetch is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JavaScript Fetch, Credentials, and Cookies**: The project's APIs must consistently handle authorization options. This involves setting the fetch mode to 'cors' and including credentials in the fetch options. This setup enables cookies to be passed between the frontend and backend during requests, facilitating user authentication and session management. These options are defined by including the `assets/js/config.js` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nginx, Credentials, and Cookies**: For deployment and cookie handling, the project's authorization credentials need to be defined in the Nginx configuration. This is done by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` directive in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` application configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nginx and CORS**: For deployment, CORS policies need to be configured in Nginx. This involves setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` directive in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` application configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nginx and HTTP Methods**: For deployment, the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that the application uses need to be allowed in the Nginx configuration. This is done by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Method` directive in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` application configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python, CORS**: For both localhost development and deployment, the project needs to consider Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The CORS policies should be built into the Python code, specifically in your `__init__.py` file. This setup allows the necessary access between your frontend and backend, supporting both development and deployment environments.  **Note**, remove similar code from main.py if you picked up an old version from Teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python, instance data**: In your `__init__.py` file, you need to configure the settings for your database and uploads. These settings should ensure that data and files persist outside of the Docker container. If not correctly configured, any data stored in the database or any files uploaded will be lost when the Docker container is stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python, authentication and authorization**: In this implementation, the decorator `@token_required` is used to guard HTTP endpoints. This uses the allowed credentials which send the cookie to the application. The application unwraps the cookie and uses the user id to query and return the user object from the database. The user object can be used in the application logic of the API to identify the request to the owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python, CSRF**: When deploying your server, it's crucial to manage secret keys for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) `__init__.py` file. This secret key is used to generate unique tokens that help protect your application against CSRF attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Certbot, HTTPS**: For deployment security, using HTTPS is crucial to prevent sensitive information from being intercepted over the internet. Certbot is the tool of choice used in this project to automate the process of obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates. Running `sudo certbot --nginx` will modify the Nginx configuration to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, enhancing the security of your application. It's important to note that this step is vital for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit. Always verify the configuration change after running the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "These considerations are crucial for successfully deploying a web application from localhost to a live server. They ensure your application remains functional and secure in the new environment."

    "## Login and Security in Python / Flask project\n",
    "A big portion of any deployed frontend to backend project is to enable User login and security. This project is using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to enable and guard endpoints according authentication and authorization.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Login Request***. The frontend receives the user's ID and password as input and performs an HTTP POST request to log in and authenticate the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Login Response***.  The backend validates the credentials against the stored database and prepares a JSON response with the authentication status, e.g., 'Login success' with a 200 status code, or 'Bad request' with a 400 status code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***JWT cookie***. If the login is successful, the backend returns a JWT that is stored in the web browser as a cookie. Subsequent requests to the server will include this JWT in the credentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Security decorator***.  Python endpoints in the backend that require login credentials will be protected with the @token_required decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***User credentials***.  The backend endpoint code can use the return values from the @token_required decorator to control logic based on the user's ID and their authorization level."

    "- Unguarded requests\n",
    "  - POST request for signing up and creating new users.\n",

    "## Relationship of Full Stack and Deployment to College Board questions\n",
    "This final section helps you build a mental map between work you are doing and the questions you will be responsible to answer on the College Board exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How computers send and receive information using computer systems, computer networks, and packets.\n",
    "In the context of a Full Stack application, the process of sending and receiving information is fundamental. Whether it's a user logging in, submitting a form, or retrieving data, information is constantly being exchanged between the client and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How computer systems and networks facilitate the transfer of data?  \n",
    "The Full Stack application is a perfect example of how computer systems and networks facilitate data transfer. The frontend sends requests to the backend over the network, the backend processes these requests and sends responses back to the frontend. \n",
    "\n",
    "- JavaScript Fetch, URI, Credentials, and Cookie. The JavaScript fetch API is used to send requests from the frontend to the backend, and the responses are received and processed. The use of credentials and cookies is part of the HTTP protocol, which is an Internet protocol used to standardize how requests and responses are formatted and transmitted over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nginx, Credentials, Cookies, CORS, and HTTP Methods: These points also relate to how computers send and receive information. Nginx is a web server that handles incoming requests and sends responses. The configuration of Nginx determines how requests are processed, including which HTTP methods are allowed, how CORS policies are handled, and how cookies and credentials are managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How information is transmitted on the Internet?\n",
    "When you deploy your application to a server, it becomes accessible on the Internet. Users send requests to your server over the Internet, and your server sends responses back over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python, CORS, instance data, CSRF: These points relate to how information is processed on the server side. CORS policies determine how requests from different origins are handled. Instance data and CSRF protection are important aspects of managing data and security on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Purpose of Internet protocols.\n",
    "Internet protocols like HTTP and HTTPS are used to standardize how requests and responses are formatted and transmitted over the Internet. They also define how to handle errors and security. For instance, when a user submits a login form, the browser uses the HTTP protocol to send a POST request to the server. The server then responds with a status code, such as 200 for success or 401 for unauthorized, according to the HTTP protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Certbot, HTTPS: This point relates to the purpose of Internet protocols. HTTPS is an Internet protocol that provides secure communication over a computer network. Certbot is a tool used to obtain and install SSL/TLS certificates, which are required for HTTPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- SSL/TLS certificates are digital certificates that use public key cryptography to establish a secure connection between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., a deployed backend). They contain a public key for encrypting data and are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The corresponding private key, kept secure on the server, is used to decrypt the data. This mechanism ensures that the data transferred between the client and server remains confidential and integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Relationship between Internet and World Wide Web.\n",
    "The Internet is the infrastructure that allows computers to connect and communicate. The World Wide Web is a service that operates over the Internet, and it's what your users interact with when they use your deployed application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Look at different network solutions that are fault-tolerant and how that facilitates the transfer of data.\n",
    "Fault tolerance is a crucial aspect of any network solution, especially in a production environment. It ensures that your application remains accessible even when certain components fail. Let's explore how deploying your application on a cloud service like AWS can provide fault tolerance and facilitate the smooth transfer of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ability for network to provide fault tolerance.\n",
    "Deploying your application on a cloud service like AWS can provide fault tolerance. If your server goes down, AWS can automatically start a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How fault tolerance is achieved?\n",
    "Fault tolerance can be achieved through various methods like redundancy, where multiple instances of your application are running simultaneously, and if one fails, the others continue to operate. For example, in AWS you can use Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances and automatically adjust capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fault Tolerance includes the importance of data and file persistence outside of the Docker container. This is a form of fault tolerance, as it ensures that data is not lost if the Docker container is stopped.  Additionally, the instance data can be placed in a AWS S3 with EBS (Elastic Block Store) or database in RDS (Relational Database System) for snapshots of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How the Internet is fault-tolerant?\n",
    "The Internet is inherently fault-tolerant due to its decentralized nature. If one path between two computers is unavailable, the data can be routed through a different path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How parallel and distributed computing leverage multiple computers to solve complex problems or process large data sets more quickly.\n",
    "In the world of web applications, efficiency is key. Users expect quick responses and seamless experiences. One way to achieve this is through parallel and distributed computing, which allows us to leverage the power of multiple computers to process requests more quickly. Let's delve into how this concept applies to a Full Stack application.\n",

    "Parallel and Distributed Computing are inherent in the architecture of a full stack application. The frontend and backend of the application can be considered as distributed systems that operate in parallel. The backend may also use parallel processing to handle multiple requests simultaneously.\n",

    "1. Ability of parallel solution to improve efficiency.\n",
    "In the context of a Full Stack application, parallel processing can be used to handle multiple requests simultaneously, improving the efficiency of your application. For instance, Gunicorn, a Python WSGI HTTP Server, can spawn multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. Each worker process can handle one request at a time, so having multiple workers allows your application to handle multiple requests in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assign parallel processes to optimize speed.\n",
    "Your server can be configured to handle multiple requests in parallel, which can significantly improve response times, especially under heavy load.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difference between run in parallel or in sequence\n",
    "Running tasks in parallel means they're all running at the same time, while running them in sequence means they run one after the other. In the context of a server, handling requests in parallel can provide much faster response times than handling them in sequence."
